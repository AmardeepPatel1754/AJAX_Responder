# AJAX_Responder

This repository contains a web application created as a college project for the purpose of demonstrating AJAX (Asynchronous JavaScript and XML) interaction. The application fetches and displays data from a server using AJAX requests based on user actions.

# Features
* First Button: Sends a basic AJAX request to the server and displays the response in a centered and stylized heading on the page.
* Second Button (Radio Choices): Sends AJAX requests based on the user's radio button choice (Mario or StarWars). The response is formatted into a table and displayed on the page.

# Project Details
* Technology Stack:
* * HTML
  * CSS (Bootstrap 5 for styling)
  * Javascript (Vanilla JS for logic)
  * AJAX for asynchronous communication with the server

# Note
This project was created as part of a college assignment to showcase understanding and implementation of AJAX interactions in web development.

# Acknowledgments
* The project utilizes Bootstrap 5 for styling and icons.
* The AJAX requests are made to the server-side PHP script at "https://csunix.mohawkcollege.ca/~adams/10259/a6_responder.php".
